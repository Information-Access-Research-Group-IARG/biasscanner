## About Us
Welcome to the Bias Scanner Project! We're all about using technology to tackle bias in online news. Bias Scanner is here to help you navigate the sometimes tricky world of online news, so you can make more informed choices about what you read.

### Why BiasScanner?
In today's world, many of us get our news from the internet. Unfortunately, the web is also home to a lot of biased reporting, fake news, and other not-so-great stuff. Bias Scanner was created to give you a hand in spotting bias when you're reading news articles online.

### What's BiasScanner All About?
BiasScanner is a handy browser plug-in that uses some fancy machine learning tech to find sentences in news articles that might be biased. It works right in your web browser, highlighting potentially biased sentences as you read. If you want to dive deeper, it can even give you a more detailed analysis of the article.

### Why It's Cool:
- Inline Highlighting: It helps you spot potential bias as you read.
- Detailed Analysis: If you're curious, it can provide a more in-depth look at the article.
- Bias Strength: It rates how strong the detected bias is, from 0 to 1.
- Privacy Matters: We're big on privacy - no storing your personal info, ever. We only keep information about the news stories you read when you say explicitly donate them for our research.
